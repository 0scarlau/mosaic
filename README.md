## SETUP

Assuming you already have python installed:

1: Create python virtual environment 
```
python3 -m virtualenv env
```

2: Activate the virtual environment

For windows:
```
/env/scripts/activate.bat
```
For Linux/MAC
```
source env/bin/activate
```

3: Install all python libraries required for this project
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4: There are two different options to run the mosaic code, one from using the terminal/command line or using flask 
web UI
## Running the code in terminal
Change your directory to ```C:/path_to_project/mosaic/```.
The python code by default will be reading the configuration file located in ```/config/config.yaml``` and 
these parameters are passed through into the mosaic package. It also provides the option 
to overwrite those default parameters by specifying them via the command line

Parameters:

```--target-image``` : Name of the target image to be processed <br/>
```--target-path``` : Path to the image to be processed (The default path is ```/images/target/```<br/>
```--tile-path``` : Path of the where the tile images are stored (default = ```/images/tile```)<br/>
```--tile-folder``` : Name of the folder stored in path (default = ```/images/tile```) <br/>
```--grid-size``` : Defines the amount of pixels the output image will have (default 100 x 100) <br/>
```--resize```: Resize the input tile images before being processed into mosaic <br/>
```--mosaic-image```: Filename output after mosaic has been created. Output will be saved in ```/output/```)

Example

Using default folder location
```
python src/mosaic.py --target-image=starrynight.jpg --mosaic-image=output --grid-size 100 100 --resize 50 50
```
 
 Using target image from a different location and tile folder from different location to the project
 ```
 python src/mosaic.py --target-path C:\path_to_image\ --target-image image.jpg --tile-path C:\path_to_tile_folder 
 --grid-size 100 100 resize 30 30 
 ```
 
 ## Running the code using Flask Web UI
 Change your directory to ```C:/path_to_project/mosaic/```.
 
 Run the flask application
 ```
 python mosaic_app.py
 ```
 
 NOTE: The flask application is restricted to use all target images and tile images from the package itself and no option
 of using images outside the project directory.

You can also run the Flask application use docker containers 

```
docker build -t mosaic_app .
```

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 localhost/mosaic_app
```
